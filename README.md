# Architecture overview
![architecture](./assets/architecture.jpg)
* The overall architecture of our model begins with training a shared grid in the **frequency domain**. This is followed by
**scale-specific low-pass filters** designed to facilitate focus on crucial information. Subsequently, **learnable frequency masks** are
applied to further refine frequency grids. To enhance visual clarity, the grid is shown as a basic square shape, even though it is
fundamentally a vector matrix structure. The âŠ™ represents element-wise multiplication.

# Environment setup

* conda create -n freqMipAA python=3.8
* conda activate freqMipAA
* pip install -r requirements.txt


# Training
* run the commands below at "/your/path/to/mipTensoRF" inside the docker container.

* FreqMipAA on the multi-scale blender dataset.
```
bash ./scripts/multiscale_freqMipAA.sh
```
